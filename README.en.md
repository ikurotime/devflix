Welcome to the DevFlix repository, a redesigned Netflix clone focused on offering a platform to watch Web Development and Web Design tutorial videos.

Developed live on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/ikurotime) channel of [ikurotime](https://davidhuertas.dev)

## Used Technologies 🚀

- **Qwik:** Qwik is the framework used for the rapid and efficient development of the user interface.

- **QuikCity:** QwikCity is just an extra set of tools on top of Qwik to make it easier to build a full site, including directory-based routing, layouts, and more.

- **Supabase:** Supabase is the choice for DevFlix's backend. It is an open source platform that combines a PostgreSQL database with a RESTful API service to accelerate backend development.

- **Prisma:** Prisma handles DevFlix's database. It provides a modern and simple database interface that makes it easy to query and manipulate data.

- **DaisyUI:** The interface styles are designed with DaisyUI, a component library for Tailwind CSS. DaisyUI offers a clean and modern aesthetic that enhances the visual experience of users.
